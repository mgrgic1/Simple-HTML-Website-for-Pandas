  <p>The giant panda, <i>Ailuropoda Melanoleuca</i> is a bear native to China. While pandas can't do Kung Fu, they are able to climb trees starting at 7 months old. A panda's spends almost all of their time in solitude, either eating for up to 14 hours a day or sleeping. A panda's diet consists mainly of bamboo. Because bamboo has little nutritional content, they eat between 12 to 38 kilograms every day!</p>  
  <p>While they have been around for nearly two to three million years, pandas have been threatened with extinction since the 1990s. Their main threats are deforestation, habitat destruction, and poachers. Deforestation and poaching in the early 1990s were the biggest threats to pandas, leaving them without any bamboo or the victim of a poacher. In addition to this, as China's population grows, panda habitats get taken over for construction or development. This results in food shortages and panda relocation to smaller, less livable habitats.</p>
  <p>In September of 2016, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature upgraded the status of panda from endangered to vulnerable. The Chinese government has taken measures to restore and protect panda habitats, as well the bamboo that they need to survive. While this is an improvement, it is not enough.<br><br>Your donations help with a variety of panda preservation projects, including:<br>
  
  <ul style = "list-style-type:square;">
	<li><b>Habitat Protection: </b> Donation costs cover habitat protection projects so that pandas will have a large, spacious, and bamboo rich environment to live in.</li>
	<li><b>Research and Development: </b> We ensure that pandas are kept safe by using state of the art 4K cameras to monitor panda habitats and the surrounding area. This ensures that no illegal projects, hunting, or habitat destruction of any kind takes place.</li>
	<li><b>Community Projects:</b> We enlist members of the community to help with panda habitat protection. Our community projects include volunteers growing bamboo and training for stealth attacks against poachers.</li>
